## Abstract- 
The ‘blockchain’ is the core principle behind Bitcoin digital currency. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed technology that use to store a digital record of any event. A set of algorithms agrees to generate a new block that is valid as well as true. The data structure affiliated with each block makes it tamper-proof. This paper proposes a permanent distributed ledger of Academic record based on the private blockchain.

## Proposed System
The proposed system is divided into two parts; Verification area and Published area. Verification area provides the details of students and their academic records to the outer world to verify it. The published area is under control of University/College where the students’ personal information and transcript data of academic records are published on the blockchain.
 
### Verification Area
Verification area is a public interface to verify or to view the academic record of students by just entering government provided ID card numbers. Web-based or RestFull API is required to implement the verification area. Fully open access part of the system is connected to a node of blockchain has the permission of mining and explore blockchain.
ID card No.---> Verification System ----> Search in Blockchain ---> Required Academic Record
### Published area
The published area is a private interface to insert students’ personal information and academic records. As its function is split into two parts: Student Information and Academic Record. Private access part of the system is connected to a node of blockchain has the permission of mining, exploration and can also add a new block to the blockchain.
